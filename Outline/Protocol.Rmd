#Background

##Bats

###General information

Bats (Order Chiroptera), are the only group of mammals that are capable of flight.
characteristics of wings and flight adaptations (also physiology)

This group is one of the most diverse order of mammals in the world with around 1240 species [@tudge2000variety], second only to rodents. main groups

####Adaptations for flight

Bats have several adaptations for flight [@norberg1998morphological]

reproduction

####Hibernation or migration

Most north-american bats hibernate during the winter, some species migrate regionally (140 to 350 miles), in order to get to central hybernacula. Some other bats however can migrate upto 1180 miles to get to warmer latitudes [@fleming2003ecology, @mcguire2012migratory] and avoid hibernating all together. Some species such as the silver-haired bats (*Lasionycteris noctivagans*) may migrate over 155 miles a day [@mcguire2012migratory]. In general bats that live in higher latitudes tend to be migratory whereas bats that live in lower latitudes usually don't migrate, this is partly due to colder temperatures in higher latitudes, but also there is a higher Temperature Annual Range in higher latitudes as seen in the graph below (data extracted from @hijmans2005very).

```{r,echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=TRUE}
library(raster)
library(ggplot2)
bio <- getData('worldclim' ,  var='bio', res=10)
tdif<- (bio[[7]]/10)
zones <- init(tdif, v='y')
zones <- abs(zones)
z <- zonal(tdif, zones, 'mean', na.rm= TRUE)
z <- as.data.frame(z)
z2 <- zonal(tdif, zones, "sd", na.rm = TRUE)
z2 <- as.data.frame(z2)
z <- cbind(z, z2$sd)
colnames(z) <- c("Latitude", "meanT", "sd")
ggplot(z, aes(x = Latitude, y= meanT)) +  geom_ribbon(ymax = (z$meanT + z$sd), ymin = (z$meanT  - z$sd), fill = "gray") + geom_line() + theme_classic() +labs(x="Latitude", y= "Max temperature - Min temperature") +  ylim(c(0,60))
```

Bats in higher latitudes migrate to escape lower temperatures, which bring scarsity of invertebrates [@fleming2003ecology]. It has also been established that 

Most bats (around 70% of them) feed on invertebrates, other species are frugivores, or pollinators. Some very specialized groups of bats feed exclusively on blood.

###Bats in northamerica
- General information about bats biology, taxonomy, and natural history.
main groups
no species by region
adaptations like hibernation in different areas
There are 51 species of bats in North-america, those bats belong to four distinct families [@bradley2014revised]. The patterns of diversity are shown in the map below, where we see that bats are more abundant in the southwestern portion of the United States [@jenkins2013global]

#Site Selection

##The importance in selecting heterogeneus environments

This often improves the representativeness of the sample by reducing sampling error. It can produce a weighted mean that has less variability than the arithmetic mean of a simple random sample of the population.

In computational statistics, stratified sampling is a method of variance reduction when Monte Carlo methods are used to estimate population statistics from a known population.

The reasons to use stratified sampling rather than simple random sampling include[1]

If the population density varies greatly within a region, stratified sampling will ensure that estimates can be made with equal accuracy in different parts of the region, and that comparisons of sub-regions can be made with equal statistical power. For example, in Ontario a survey taken throughout the province might use a larger sampling fraction in the less populated north, since the disparity in population between north and south is so great that a sampling fraction based on the provincial sample as a whole might result in the collection of only a handful of data from the north.

Randomized stratification can also be used to improve population representativeness in a study.
